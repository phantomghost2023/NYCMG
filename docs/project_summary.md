# NYCMG Project Summary

## Project Overview

The NYCMG (NYC Music Growth) project is an ambitious initiative to create a hyper-local, artist-owned digital ecosystem for NYC music discovery and curation. This platform aims to revolutionize how music is discovered, consumed, and supported in New York City by returning music discovery and curation to the community while ensuring artists retain 100% ownership of their work.

## Vision and Mission

### Core Philosophy
- **Mission**: To create a hyper-local, artist-owned digital ecosystem that returns music discovery and curation to the community, making NYC the global epicenter of authentic musical innovation once again.

### Key Differentiators
- **Artist Sovereignty**: Artists retain 100% ownership of their masters and publishing
- **Community-Powered Curation**: Human-led, geography-based curation instead of algorithmic homogenization
- **Geo-Centric Discovery**: Unique cultural identity of each borough as the primary organizational principle
- **Radical Intuition**: Effortless user experience that mirrors the organic discovery of music in NYC neighborhoods

## Technical Architecture

The NYCMG platform is built on a modern, scalable microservices architecture designed to support the unique requirements of a hyper-local music platform:

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native (mobile), React.js with Next.js (web)
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js microservices
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis caching
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers orchestrated with Kubernetes on AWS
- **Streaming**: CDN-based audio delivery with adaptive bitrate streaming

### System Components
1. **User Authentication & Management Service**
2. **Content Management Service**
3. **Discovery & Recommendation Service**
4. **Playback & Streaming Service**
5. **Events & Community Service**
6. **Payment & Revenue Service**
7. **Analytics & Reporting Service**
