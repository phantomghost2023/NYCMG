- Added graceful handling of missing files
- Improved logging and progress reporting

## Modules Successfully Installed

### Backend
- All dependencies installed in `backend/node_modules`
- Key packages: express, sequelize, pg, jsonwebtoken, joi, winston
- Development dependencies: jest, nodemon, supertest, eslint

### Web
- All dependencies installed in `web/node_modules`
- Key packages: next, react, react-dom, @reduxjs/toolkit, axios
- UI libraries: @mui/material, @mui/icons-material, mapbox-gl

### Mobile

## Verification

The installation has been verified by checking that:
1. All module directories contain populated `node_modules` folders
2. No error messages were reported during installation
3. All dependencies are using currently supported versions

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Eliminated Installation Errors**: All dependency conflicts have been resolved
2. **Reduced Deprecation Warnings**: Updated to supported package versions
3. **Improved Performance**: Newer package versions offer better performance
4. **Enhanced Security**: Updated packages include the latest security fixes
5. **Future-Proof**: Using actively maintained packages ensures long-term maintainability

## Next Steps

1. Run tests to ensure all functionality works correctly with updated dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. Start development servers to verify the applications run correctly:
   ```bash
   # Backend
   cd backend && npm run dev
   
   # Web
   cd web && npm run dev
   
   # Mobile
   cd mobile && npm start
   ```

3. If any compatibility issues are found with the updated packages, refer to the migration guides for the updated packages.

## Conclusion

The dependency installation issues in the NYCMG project have been successfully resolved. The project now uses modern, supported dependencies that should provide a stable foundation for development.
