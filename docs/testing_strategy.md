# NYCMG Testing Strategy and Quality Assurance Protocols

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy and quality assurance protocols for the NYCMG platform, ensuring the delivery of a robust, secure, and high-quality application that meets the needs of users, artists, and administrators while maintaining the platform's unique value proposition of hyper-local, artist-centric music discovery.

## Testing Philosophy

### Quality First Approach
- Testing is integrated throughout the development lifecycle
- Automated testing coverage targets 80%+ of codebase
- Manual testing validates user experience and edge cases
- Security and performance testing are mandatory for all releases
- Accessibility compliance is verified for all user interfaces

### Shift-Left Testing
- Test planning begins during requirements gathering
- Unit testing starts with feature development
- Early integration testing identifies architectural issues
- Continuous testing in CI/CD pipeline
- User acceptance testing during development phases

### Risk-Based Testing
- Critical user flows receive highest testing priority
- Security-sensitive features undergo rigorous validation
- Performance-critical components tested under load
- Platform stability verified before feature releases
- Regression testing ensures existing functionality remains intact

## Testing Types and Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing

#### Scope and Coverage
- All business logic functions and methods
- API endpoint handlers and middleware
- Data transformation and validation functions
- Utility and helper functions
- Target: 85%+ code coverage

#### Tools and Frameworks
- **Backend**: Jest for Node.js services
- **Frontend**: Jest with React Testing Library
- **Mobile**: Jest with React Native Testing Library
- **Database**: Custom test helpers for data layer

#### Implementation Approach
- Test-driven development (TDD) for new features
- Isolated testing with mocks and stubs
- Data-driven testing for validation scenarios
- Continuous integration execution
- Code coverage reporting and monitoring

#### Sample Test Structure
```javascript
// Example unit test for artist verification
describe('Artist Verification Service', () => {
  describe('verifyArtist', () => {
    it('should approve valid NYC artist', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should reject invalid proof of residency', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should handle verification timeout gracefully', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### 2. Integration Testing

describe('Authentication API', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Setup test database and services
  });
  
  describe('POST /api/v1/auth/login', () => {
    it('should authenticate valid user credentials', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should reject invalid credentials', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
    
    it('should handle rate limiting', async () => {
      // Test implementation
    });
  });
});
```

### 3. End-to-End Testing

// Example end-to-end test for music discovery
describe('Music Discovery User Journey', () => {
  before(() => {
    // Setup test user and content
  });
  
  it('should allow user to discover music by borough', () => {
    // Navigate to app
    cy.visit('/');
    
    // Select borough
    cy.get('[data-testid="borough-map"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-testid="brooklyn-borough"]').click();
    
    // Browse genre neighborhood
    cy.get('[data-testid="genre-neighborhood"]').first().click();
    
    // Play track
    cy.get('[data-testid="play-button"]').first().click();
    
    // Verify playback
    cy.get('[data-testid="player"]').should('be.visible');
